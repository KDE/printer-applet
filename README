printer-applet is a system tray utility.  It shows current print jobs,
shows printer warnings and errors and shows when printers that have
been plugged in for the first time are being auto-configured by
hal-cups-utils.

It replaces kjobviewer in KDE 3.

It is a KDE port of system-config-printer's applet.py by Tim Waugh from Red Hat.

Dependencies are...

PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/

PyKDE4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/ or kdebindings

python-cups:  http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/pycups/

hal-cups-utils:  https://fedorahosted.org/hal-cups-utils/

hal-cups-utils needs the common parts of system-config-printer (cupshelpers/*, ppds.py, probe_printer.py):

Note to packagers: system-config-printer is a Gnome app, please split
out the parts needed by printer-applet (and kdeadmin's
system-config-printer-kde) into a separate packages to stop KDE
needing Gnome dependencies.  See for example these Ubuntu packages:
